C Piscine C 00 – Exercises
This repository contains my solutions to the first 6 exercises from the C Piscine C 00 module at 42 School. These exercises focus on mastering basic C programming concepts and using system-level functions like write(). Below is a detailed breakdown of the tasks I have completed.

Exercises Completed:  
Exercise 00: ft_putchar  
Objective: Write a function ft_putchar that takes a single character as input and prints it to the standard output using the write() function.  
  
Key Learnings:  
Understanding function prototypes and system calls.  
Using the write() function to output data.  
  
Exercise 01: ft_print_alphabet  
Objective: Create a function ft_print_alphabet that prints the alphabet in lowercase, from 'a' to 'z', all on one line.  
  
Key Learnings:  
Loops and character manipulation in C.  
Displaying a sequence of characters in ascending order.  
  
Exercise 02: ft_print_reverse_alphabet  
Objective: Implement ft_print_reverse_alphabet, a function that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, from 'z' to 'a'.  
  
Key Learnings:  
Looping through characters in reverse.  
Efficient handling of output formatting.  
  
Exercise 03: ft_print_numbers  
Objective: Develop ft_print_numbers, which prints all digits (0 through 9) on a single line.
    
Key Learnings:  
Managing numeric characters using loops.  
Simple formatting of digits.  
  
Exercise 04: ft_is_negative  
Objective: Write a function ft_is_negative that takes an integer and prints 'P' if the number is positive or zero, and 'N' if it’s  negative.  
  
Key Learnings:  
Conditional statements in C.   
Handling integer parameters in a function.  
  
Exercise 05: ft_print_comb  
Objective: Create a function ft_print_comb that prints all possible different combinations of three digits in ascending order, separated by commas.  
  
Key Learnings:  
Nested loops and logical conditions for unique combinations.
Formatting output using a controlled structure for spacing and commas.   
  
Tools and Technologies:
Language: C
Compiler flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror to catch potential issues in code.
Version Control: Git for versioning and submission through the 42 School repository system.

How to Run:

1 - Clone this repository

    git clone 

2 - Navigate to the exercise directory and compile the C file. For example, for Exercise 00:
  
    cd ex00
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ft_putchar.c -o ft_putchar
    ./ft_putchar

Conclusion:  
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of C fundamentals. By implementing basic functions and following the strict Norm guidelines, I gained a solid foundation in C programming and system-level development.
